# Troubleshooting

- Docker build fails: Recheck the Docker daemon and CLI proxy settings, then restart the Docker daemon.
- USB preparation fails: Verify the device path and available USB capacity.
- `kubectl` issues: Confirm that the Kubernetes installation has completed and the node status is `Ready`.
- GPU or NPU not detected: Inspect `dmesg` for driver load failures.
