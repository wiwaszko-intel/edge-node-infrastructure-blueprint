# Build from Source

This guide covers Phase 1 of the provisioning workflow: building bootable USB artifacts on the developer system.

Before starting, confirm your system meets all [System Requirements](./system-requirements.md).

For Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), follow the steps in the [Windows WSL Guide](../how-to/set-up-windows-wsl.md).

## Phase 1: Build Artifacts on the Developer System

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-node-infrastructure-blueprint.git -b main
cd edge-node-infrastructure-blueprint
```

### 2. Build Bootable USB Artifacts

From the repository root, run one of the following build modes.

> **Note:** If your development environment is behind a firewall, add proxy configuration to the
> `proxy.env` file in the `edge-node-infrastructure-blueprint` directory. To skip the proxy settings,
> pass `skip-proxy=true` to the make command.

#### Option 1: Build from a Standard 24.04 Minimal desktop image

Build the Ubuntu image, including the required tools and packages, from an Ubuntu minimal desktop image:

> **Note**: Default credentials are `user`/`user`. For production, replace the SHA-512 hash in `infrastructure/host-os/Dockerfile` with your new password using:
> ```bash
> openssl passwd -6 'your-new-password'  # or mkpasswd --method=sha-512 'your-new-password'
> ```

Before building, update the default user credentials in `infrastructure/host-os/auto-install-pkgs.yaml`. Replace the default `user` name and `passwd` hash with your own values:

```yaml
user-data:
  users:
  - name: <your-username>
    passwd: "<SHA-512-hashed-password>"
```

Generate the password hash using one of the following methods:

```bash
# Using openssl (requires `openssl` to be installed)
openssl passwd -6 'your-password-here'

# Using mkpasswd (requires `whois` to be installed)
mkpasswd --method=sha-512 'your-password-here'
```

> **Note:** The output changes on every invocation because the salt is randomly generated. All outputs verify against the same password.

```bash
make build
```

Or explicitly specify the standard mode:

```bash
make build MODE=standard-image
```

#### Option 2 (Advanced): Build with Image Composer Tool Image

This path is intended for advanced users who need fine-grained control over disk
layout, installed packages, and package repositories. Most users can start with
Option 1.

To generate an image using Image Composer Tool, refer to:

- [Advanced Image Customization (Using Image Composer Tool)](../how-to/advanced-image-customization.md).

### Build Output

With any of the above build options, expect the following output:

- `usb-installation-files.tar.gz` in `infrastructure/build-artifacts/out`

Once the build completes, continue to [Prepare USB and Validate](./prepare-usb.md).
